# WhatPeopleWant
Agent to help builders find what to build (build on exosphere.host)
WhatPeopleWant is an intelligent agent designed to help builders, makers, and entrepreneurs discover high-impact problems to solve, leveraging the power of [exosphere.host](https://exosphere.host).

## How It Works

We scrape and analyze discussions from Hacker News to identify what people are asking for, what is missing, or what is underserved by current tools in the market. Using this data, a large language model (LLM) generates actionable problem statements for builders. The agent surfaces real needs and opportunities based on what the community is talking about right now.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NiveditJain/WhatPeopleWant.git
   cd WhatPeopleWant
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):**
